\noindent
Mangaki is a manga/anime recommendation website: \url{http://mangaki.fr}.

#### Pitch

Everyone regularly ask themselves what movie, series or book they should watch next, according to their tastes. Mangaki wants to innovate access to culture by providing a unique user experience.

Innovation: Adaptive Testing for Personalized Recommendations {-}
=============================================================

In a typical recommendation website, a user rates a few anime (*Favorite / Like / Dislike / Neutral / Want to see / Will not see*) and the system provides suggestions of new works they might like. But newcomers usually have to rate **a lot** of items before they get satisfying recommendations.\bigskip

\noindent
What distinguishes Mangaki from other recommender systems is a Tinder-like **adaptive test** for newcomers, asking the user « ***Did you like these works?*** ». Thus, Mangaki's algorithm automatically selects works that will bring the most information about the user's tastes. This makes it possible to provide relevant recommendations really fast.
